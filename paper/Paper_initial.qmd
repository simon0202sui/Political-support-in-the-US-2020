## Data Source



## Methodology

## Variables

There have 2 file each are clean data and simulated data, for each two file are both csv file. In the cleaned data has 7 variables, each are vote_intention, support_biden, party, education, race, age_group, gender. In the simulated data has 4 variables, each are race, age_group, gender, support biden. Because of the raw data is 800MB with 1000+ variable, it will not list each one here. You can find the variable statement in the /other/guide.

[Clean data]{.underline}

-   vote_intention, (1-Yes, 2-No, 3-other) (num)
-   support_biden, (No, Yes, Other) (char)
-   party, (Democratic, Republican, other) (char)
-   education, (No HS, High school, College, Postgrad, other) (char)
-   race, (White, Black, American Indian, Asian, Other)
-   age_group(18~39, 31-61, 62-95) (char)
-   gender (Male, Female) (char)

[Clean data]{.underline}

-   race, (White, Black, American Indian, Asian, Other) (char)
-   age_group, ('18-30', '31-61', '62-95') (char)
-   gender (Male, Female) (char)
